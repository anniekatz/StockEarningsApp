Created with Python 3.9 in Pycharm

TO INSTALL PROGRAM AS EXECUTABLE:
-In most cases, you need to have Python 3 installed and added to PATH.
-You need to have Pyinstaller and a PATH variable to the folder of its location, 
an (upgraded) pip PATH environment variable, and Python 3.
-Navigate to program folder sp-500-earnings in the command line.
-Run "python install.py" (or "python3 install.py")
-A folder called dist will be created, with the executable file "gui.exe" inside. 
Executable may take a few moments to run.

They are installed in the dist folder along with the executable.

command line and run the gui.py file:
